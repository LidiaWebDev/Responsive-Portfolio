        <p>My name is Lidia Davidson and I am a Coding Bootcamp student at UCR Extention Studies. I love solving problems, for the last five years I 
            worked in a customer-service related field, solving customers' problems all the time. </p>
            <br class="BR">

        <p> Motivation comes when I see the results of my work, learn daily something new and useful,
            when I build something meaningful. Reading different self-development recources is a part of my journey, how I keep shaping my skills and knowledge base. 
            Newtorking, soft skills is another big thing for me, I can't just see myself isolated from the society. That is probably why you can find me 
            in facebook and instargram.</p>
            <br>
        <p> My hobby is jazz dance, I do it for cardio, muscle stretching and for common harmony of the whole brian. There are other neat things that make life adventurous 
            such as travelling, camping, finding new hobbies. 
          </p>
